### Making diagram changes
All of the diagrams are in the Design/ folder, there are two files for each diagram a 
*.xml* file that can be imported into Draw.io for editing and a *.png* file that we will use to combine the diagrams
into a single PDF at the end. 

If you make any changes, please commit both the changed *.xml* and *.png* files, so that combining the PNGs will be 
a breeze later on.
