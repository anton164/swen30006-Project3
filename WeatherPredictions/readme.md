# Weather Predictions

### Assumptions in this project
- In the spec 'latitude' was spelled as 'lattitude', this was corrected.
- The response for the predictions and the past measurements was incosistent for 'rain'/'precip', we assumed that it would be more sensible to be coherent so we went with the latter.
